SUMMARY:1.1.1 Health Triangle Connections
DESCRIPTION:Rubric for Health Triangle Assignment\n\n \n\n *** SONGS MUST BE SCHOOL APPROPRIATE***\n\n This means “clean” versions of songs. \n\nTotal Points: ___30pts_____ \n\n \n\n*Choosing 1 song for each portion of the Health Triangle: 2pts each song =  \n6pts \n\n*Song Title and Artist: 2pt \n\n*Choice Lyrics: 1pt \n\n*Connections: Points are added to each song choice. : 5pts each is the Max  \nPts.\n\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\nDemonstrates an in-depth analysis of the song and its relation to the health  \ntriangle.  Makes insightful connections.\n\nConveys a thorough understanding of the song and its relation to the health  \ntriangle\,  Makes valid and clear connections.\n\nConveys a basic understanding of the song and its relation to the health  \ntriangle.  Clearly states connections but lacks elaboration on those  \nconnections\n\nConveys a simple and vague understanding of the connections between song  \nchoice and the health triangle\n\nProvides no comparison between song and the health triangle. Makes no  \nconnections. \n\n\nHere are 2 examples…\n\n \n\nyou will be responsible for 3. \n\n \n\n“Let Go” -Frou Frou\n\n \n\n So\, let go\, so let go\n\n Jump in \n\nOh well\, what you waiting for?\n\n It's alright\n\n 'Cause there's beauty in the breakdown \n\nSo\, let go\, yeah let go \n\nJust get in \n\nOh\, it's so amazing here \n\nIt's all right\n\n 'Cause there's beauty in the breakdown \n\n\nMental/Emotional Health\n\n \n\n I have always been a worrier\; it runs in my family I guess. I get nervous  \nabout the “what if’s” in life. What if I don’t do well\, what if  \nsomething goes wrong…. These feelings have never been overwhelming\, but  \nwhen it came to big decisions in my life\, I have felt the anxiety creep in. I  \ntried to find strength in songs such as Frou Frou’s Let Go. It was  \nespecially important songs throughout college as an attempt to take more  \nrisks. In my interpretation\, to “let go” meant that I needed to let go of  \nmy fears. To push through the anxiety to reach my dreams and goals. This song  \nalso reassured me that it’s alright to make mistakes and that “there’s  \nbeauty in the breakdown”. As I have aged I have learned to keep my anxiety  \nat bay… for the most part  I have also learned that it is okay to be  \nscared of things\, it actually motivates me now. Also I have learned that  \nthere is a beauty when things don’t work out as planned. It makes us  \nstronger and rich with experiences in the long run. \n\n\n“Just the way you are” -Bruno Mars \n\n \n\nOh you know\, you know\, you know\n\n I'd never ask you to change \n\nIf perfect's what you're searching for\n\n Then just stay the same \n\nSo don't even bother asking if you look okay \n\nYou know I'll say. \n\n \n\nWhen I see your face\n\n There's not a thing that I would change\n\n 'Cause you're amazing Just the way you are \n\n\nPhysical Health \n\n \n\n“Just the way you are” is an excellent song that relates to my idea of  \nPhysical Health. We live in a society that unfortunately places so much value  \non physical appearances. Eating disorders are claiming the lives of beautiful  \npeople each day. Americans spend millions of dollars on fad diets in an  \nattempt to fit into an image that the majority of people were never meant to  \nfit into. I understand eating healthy\, having a low BMI\, and getting exercise  \nto get healthy\, however I feel too much pressure is out there.  \nSelf-confidence should not be rooted in physical appearance. Bruno Mars  \nstates that there is “not a thing I would change” about the person he is  \nwith. He believes that they are amazing just the way they are. People need to  \nbelieve that they are beautiful the way they are. Way to sing it Bruno!!!\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  - Link: http://schoology.lsr7.org/assignment/4595841752
